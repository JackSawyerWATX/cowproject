# Simple Test Program

This is a simple test to play around with a package I just learned about today, 8.4.2025.

## To Open and Run

1. Open the terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `test.py`.
3. Run the following command outside of a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   py test.py

That is all. That's the program.

Thank you!
